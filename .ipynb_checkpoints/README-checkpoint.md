notebooks for neural networks skill session 2024-03-01

## Sections:
- Network basics
  - What actually is a neural network?
    - Flexible, customisable polynomial
    - Series of "fully connected layers"
    - Complex to follow, but easy to understand
  - Look at a single layer
    - Linear function
    - Single neuron, single layer
    - Activation function?
  - Code up and linear fit
    - Try for linear fit of data point
    - Optimise manually
    - Scale up?
- Network Caveats + Data Prep
  - Overfitting
    - What is overfitting?
    - Show with simple (sin curve etc)
    - Easily fixed by carefuly dealing with data
  - Data prep
    - Explain train, test, validation
    - Show how validation can be used to make sure we aren't overfitting
    - Show how we use test set to estimate emulation uncertainty
  - Extrapolation
    - Networks aren't magic
    - Unless hard coded in, they don't know what are reasonable outputs or inputs
    - This is dangerous if we aren't careful, but can be fun (show later)
- Stellar data
  - Emulating a track
    - Load in simple grid, spanning but not including solar like
    - Plot of track
  - Extrapolation
    - Negative mass
    - AGN black hole mass
    - Down to negative age
  - Try to optimise
    - Experiment with layers, nodes, maybe more
    - Leaderboard
